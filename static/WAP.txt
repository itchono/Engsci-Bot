Waves and Particles 
An original parody by Daniel Foster and Kate Whelan

Holes in this graph
There’s some holes in this graph
There’s some holes in this graph
There’s some holes in this graph (Hol’ up)
I said certified geek, seven days a week
Wave and particle theory make that standard model weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah you flunkin’ with some wave and particle theory
Bring a potential well and a model for this wave and particle theory
Give me everything you got for this wave and particle theory
Beat it up, Coulomb, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this textbook right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna derive
I approach the limit from both sides
Drool on my book, sleep in my eyes
This problem’s hard, come take a try
Tears in my eyes like I’m surprised
Let’s Poincaré, I’ll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big math truck right in this little Lagrange
Concrete beam, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I won’t look, I won’t cheat
But let me tell you how I got this rank (Ayy, ayy)
Graphing me, solving me, draw down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out ‘fore you solve this inequality (Yeah)
Tell him that it factors, that it’s called distributivity (Huh)
Flow down on him just like i’m Bernoulli
Use your wit, bite your lip 
Ask for an aid tryna make it click 
You really aint never gotta factor for a thang 
He already said that time’s up ‘fore I came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your ruler and a pen for this wave and particle theory
He bought a phone just for pictures 
Of this wave and particle theory
Pay my tuition just to teach me 
About this wave and particle theory 
Now feel the pain if you wanna get wave and particle theory
Look I need a hard midterm, need a deep concept
Need a big thinker, need another problem set
Got a bad headache, need a good coder 
Someone who does their work, not a freeloader
We got office hours, then that’s where I’m headed
Tryna pass the class, tryna get the credit
We got a bonus, well I’m tryna get it
No current flowing, now he a dielectric
I don’t wanna quit, I wanna code
I wanna pass, gonna explode
I want to you to adjust that class average that feels just a little too low
My head is on fire, Bernoulli, Minkowski
Test’s going back blank cuz my head went in empty
I write on that thing like there’s nothing inside of me
I spit on this mic and now who’s tryna sign me
Professor, I’m in pieces, here’s my thesis
Switch my major, eng sci i’m leaving 
Begging on my knees, give me something to achieve in
Failing every test, yeah I take a beatin’ (Ah)
That’s some WAP WAP WAP
